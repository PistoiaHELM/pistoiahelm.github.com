# HELM #


HELM (hierarchical editing language for macromolecules) is both a notation, and a set of tools and applications that implement the notation. It allows (among other things) the compact representation of complex biomolecules, includes the ability to use non-natural monomers, enables you to create conjugates of different types of polymers or small molecules and describe ambiguity. 

Our [wiki](https://pistoiaalliance.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PUB/pages/8716303/HELM+Resources) is the best place to start if you have a general interest in HELM. You can get easy access to compiled versions of the tools, links to the documentation including slide sets, videos and information about the community and project. 

Developers will find all the code here. 


### Orientation  ###

There are two major versions:

- HELM1 - (the original)
- HELM2 which added the ability to define ambiguous components, connections and compositions as well as more complex annotations and groups. 

We recommend that new starters use the HELM2 tools. The following are key components

- HELM web-editor
- HELM2 notation toolkit 
- HELM2 webservice

If you are interested in viewing and manipulating antibodies at a domain level, try the HELM Antibody editor.
